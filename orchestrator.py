"Low fit" / "good fit" above is decided against config.FIT_THRESHOLD (0.0-1.0,
default 0.7, user-configurable from the Settings page -- see
route_on_score/route_after_rewrite, both read it fresh at call time).

decide_apply_path (agents/apply_agent.py) is the single choke point both
branches above funnel into before anything can auto-submit -- it checks
config.AUTO_APPLY_MODE ("off" / "any" / "whitelist", Settings page) and, in
"whitelist" mode, config.WHITELISTED_SOURCES too. See that file's docstring
for what each mode actually does.

Every path out of decide_apply_path carries a cover letter
(agents/cover_letter_agent.py) and a CV to attach -- the tailored one when the
job was rewritten, otherwise the master CV the user uploaded.

Respects config.DRY_RUN globally: when true, auto_submit and email_apply
record status "would_apply" (what WOULD have been sent) instead of submitting
or emailing anything. A job routed to a submitter that doesn't exist yet
falls back to a draft rather than failing.
