"""
Re-scoring a tailored CV must not re-parse it with the LLM.

This was a live 500: the bench scored the master CV, paid for a full rewrite,
and then blew up sending the rewritten text back through the profile
extractor. Groq's free tier caps tokens PER MINUTE counting prompt plus the
reserved output budget, so the request was rejected with a 413 before the
model ran -- discarding a tailored CV that had already been paid for.

Skipping the re-parse is also just correct. cv_rewriter_agent may not
fabricate experience, so the rewrite cannot change the dates the profile
supplies; only the wording changes, and wording is read structurally.
