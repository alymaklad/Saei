# score was therefore a constant, contributing nothing to ranking, while

#                         mixed into a per-job number.
#   Job Match          -- "how well does this candidate satisfy THIS job?"
#                         Requirement-level matching with evidence.
#
#   "legacy"       -- the original four-pillar scorer, unchanged. Kept
#                     runnable so the 15 already-stored scores remain
#                     reproducible and comparable against.
#   "requirements" -- structured requirement extraction + evidence matching +
#                     deterministic scoring. THE DEFAULT as of 2026-08-25,
#                     after being exercised against real postings from the
#                     debug bench.
#
# The debug bench (POST /api/debug/ats) can still request either engine per
# call regardless of this setting, which is how the two get compared on a
# specific posting.
#
# WHAT THE SWITCH INVALIDATES, and what was done about each
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# A score from this engine does not mean what a score from the legacy one
# meant, so three things stop being comparable the moment it becomes the
# default:
#
#   Stored scores. Every Application row written before this date holds a
#     legacy score with a legacy-shaped breakdown. Rows now record which
#     engine produced them (Application.scoring_engine) so the dashboard
#     renders each with the matching renderer instead of showing an empty
#     breakdown for one of them. Old rows are NOT back-filled or rescored --
#     rescoring 15 jobs would cost real LLM calls to restate history nobody
#     is acting on.
#
#   FIT_THRESHOLD (below, default 0.7). Calibrated against the legacy
#     0.408-0.643 band, where it was unreachable. This engine has no 0.356
#     constant floor, so it scores genuinely poor matches far lower -- a real
#     posting measured 0.319 where its legacy score was 0.542. The threshold
#     is deliberately LEFT AT 0.7 through the cutover rather than guessed at:
#     if the new distribution also sits below it the behaviour is "rewrite
#     everything", which is exactly what the app already did and is safe,
#     whereas a threshold set too low starts auto-applying to jobs the
#     candidate does not match. Recalibrate it from real runs (the Dashboard
#     lists every score), not from a guess.
#
#   MATCH_SCORE_THRESHOLD is unaffected -- it gates on the ranking agent's
#     match_score, which this engine does not produce.
# The four-pillar scorer that SCORING_ENGINE used to select between is gone;
# there is one engine and nothing to choose. See agents/ats_agent.py.

# a subset term inside a dated role, and a flat enum cannot express that
# without inventing a row for every combination.
#
# RELATION -- how the CV term relates to the requirement.
#   exact             the requirement's own word, e.g. "PyTorch" for PyTorch
#   alias             a true synonym: Postgres for PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs

#   implied           the CV term could not have been used WITHOUT the
#                     requirement: FastAPI or PyTorch means Python was
#                     written; PostgreSQL means SQL was written; React means
#                     JavaScript. The candidate did not do something adjacent
#                     to the requirement -- they DID the requirement, under
#                     another name. Scores above subset for that reason, and
#                     below exact because the CV never says the word.
#   subset            the CV term is a KIND OF the requirement: CNN for Deep
#                     Learning, LoRA for PEFT, Git for version control.
#                     Genuine support, but not the same claim -- partial.

# CALIBRATION NOTE, 2026-08-19. The first values here were subset 0.70 /

# while the same CV describing SQLAlchemy work inside a dated project scored
# 0.70. A bare keyword in a list beat demonstrated related work -- exactly
# backwards from the premise the demonstrated/claimed split exists to encode.
#
# Now subset 0.80 / claimed 0.65, so the ordering reads:
#
#   exact or alias, demonstrated   1.00   used the term, in real work
#   implied, demonstrated          0.90   did work that required it

#
# CALIBRATION NOTE, 2026-08-27. "implied" added at 0.90, above subset and

# section, with FastAPI, PyTorch and LLM work described in dated roles, scored
# 0.65 for a Python requirement -- the skills-list discount -- while the roles
# themselves are proof that Python was written. 0.65 was measuring how the
# candidate had written their CV, not what they had done. It is not 1.00
# because the CV never says the word, which an ATS on the other side may well
# be searching for literally; the tailoring pass turns exactly that gap into a
# bridge (see agents/cv_targeting.py).
#
# Widening the gap also increases the reward for tailoring, since moving a
# skill from the list into the role that used it is now worth 35% of that
# requirement's points rather than 25%.
#
# These are still judgement calls, not measurements.
