Search Agent.

Free sources, in priority order:
  1. Greenhouse public API  — no key needed
  2. Lever public API       — no key needed
  3. RemoteOK JSON feed     — no key needed, official public API (see search_remoteok)
  4. We Work Remotely RSS   — no key needed, official public per-category feed (see search_weworkremotely)
  5. Google Sheets watchlist — free (Google Cloud service account)
  6. Sites added from the dashboard's Search tab — Greenhouse/Lever URLs reuse
     the API-backed paths above; verified job-board templates (Wuzzuf,
     Bayt.com, GulfTalent, SimplyHired, Wellfound -- see
     KNOWN_JOB_BOARD_TEMPLATES) rebuild their URL from the `position` field
     each run; anything else falls back to a best-effort generic scrape (see
     search_generic_site). All five templates are pre-added as default rows
     the first time the app runs (seed_default_search_sites) but are just
     regular rows after that -- removable from the Search tab like any other
     site.
  7. SerpAPI (Google Jobs)  — free tier, 100 searches/month, optional
  8. Himalayas, Remotive, Jobicy, Working Nomads — keyless remote-job APIs,
     always on, screened by config.SEARCH_ELIGIBLE_LOCATIONS
  9. Ashby / SmartRecruiters public job boards — no key, per-company like
     Greenhouse/Lever (config.ASHBY_BOARD_SLUGS / SMARTRECRUITERS_COMPANIES,
     or a pasted board URL on the Search tab)
 10. LinkedIn logged-out job search — opt-in via config.LINKEDIN_LOCATIONS,
     paced, descriptions fetched only for jobs that pass the title filter

RemoteOK and We Work Remotely are always-on structured sources (like
Greenhouse/Lever) rather than SearchSite rows -- they need no per-user
config and aren't Greenhouse/Lever, so they can never be whitelisted for
auto-submit (see WHITELISTABLE_SOURCES), same as google_jobs/generic.

    Pulls from every configured free source and tags each job with its source.
    This is the RETRIEVAL half of the matching pipeline, and it's deliberately
    recall-biased -- cheap title/keyword signals only, no embeddings, no LLM.
    Semantic retrieval and scoring happen afterward in agents/ranking_agent.py.

    `target_roles` is the expanded phrase list from
    agents/query_expansion_agent.py (e.g. "AI Engineer" ->
    ["AI Engineer", "Machine Learning Engineer", "Generative AI Engineer", ...]).
    When omitted, it defaults to just [position], which reproduces the exact
    pre-expansion behavior -- so every existing caller keeps working unchanged.
    It's used two ways, matching the two kinds of source here:

      Role 1 (query-DEPENDENT: SerpAPI, Wuzzuf/SimplyHired/Wellfound/Bayt
      templates, generic scraper) -- these need a literal query string to
      fetch anything at all, so EVERY phrase becomes its own fetch and the
      results are merged. SerpAPI is the exception: its free tier is
      100 searches/month, so only the first
      config.SERPAPI_EXPANSION_LIMIT phrases are ever sent there.

      Role 2 (query-INDEPENDENT: Greenhouse/Lever boards, RemoteOK, We Work
      Remotely, watchlist) -- these return everything regardless of query, so
      the phrase list is used as a broadened title filter instead: a job is
      kept if its title token-matches ANY phrase (see _matches_any_position).

    `seniority` stays a HARD filter on titles (SENIORITY_KEYWORDS heuristics)
    and is also folded into the SerpAPI query -- deliberately unchanged even
    though seniority is now also a ranking factor, since a "senior" search
    still shouldn't surface internships.

    `max_results_per_site` caps results per individual source -- None/0 means
    no cap. Applied AFTER the title filters, not before: capping first can
    silently discard every real match on a large board (confirmed in
    practice -- Greenhouse returns a company's jobs in a roughly
    alphabetical-by-title order, so a 100-job cap on a 545-job board zeroed
    out all 38 real "Software Engineer" matches, none of which happened to
    fall in the first 100 raw results). For expanded Role 1 sources the cap is
    applied to that site's COMBINED across-phrases result set, not per phrase
    -- otherwise a position expanding to 8 phrases would silently multiply the
    user's configured per-site ceiling by 8.

    `max_age_days` drops jobs older than that (Greenhouse/Lever/RemoteOK/WWR/
    SerpAPI expose a real posted date; generic scraped sites don't, so they're
    never excluded by this filter).

    `include_title_mismatches` carries jobs whose TITLE matched no target role
    forward anyway (capped at config.SEMANTIC_CANDIDATE_CAP per run) instead
    of discarding them, so the caller's semantic retriever can rescue the ones
    whose description genuinely fits the CV. Without it the semantic path is
    dead weight -- this function would already have thrown away every job it
    exists to recover. Seniority mismatches are still dropped outright, since
    seniority remains a hard filter.

    `trace` is an optional agents.search_trace.SearchTrace that records what
    each source returned before and after each filter, for the Excel debug
    report. Purely observational -- it never changes what this function does,
    and defaults to a no-op.

    Returns (jobs, source_errors), deduplicated by URL. A single
    dead/misconfigured board (e.g. a Lever slug that 404s) is skipped and
    reported in source_errors instead of aborting the whole run -- one bad
    source shouldn't block every other one.

        rescue the ones whose description genuinely fits the CV. Seniority
        mismatches ARE discarded outright, since seniority stays a hard filter.

        `enrich` is for sources whose listing has no description (LinkedIn,
        SmartRecruiters): it fetches one job's full posting and runs only on
        the jobs that survive filter + cap and aren't already saved, so its
        per-job requests stay few. Those sources' title mismatches aren't
