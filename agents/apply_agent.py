Apply Agent — the single gate any job passes through before it can be
marked for real auto-submission.

decide_apply_path(job) is governed by config.AUTO_APPLY_MODE (Settings
page's "Auto-Apply Behavior" panel), one of three values:

  "off"       — never auto-submit. Every job drafts for review, full stop.
  "any"       — auto-submit regardless of source, ignoring
                WHITELISTABLE_SOURCES/WHITELISTED_SOURCES entirely. This is
                a deliberate, explicit opt-in escape hatch from the
                whitelist-only default below -- see the module-level note in
                config.py for what it does and doesn't currently enable
                (auto_submit_greenhouse is still a Greenhouse-only stub, so
                this mode changes *routing*, not what a non-Greenhouse job
                can actually have submitted for it).
  "whitelist" — (default) the original design: only auto-submit on sources
                you've explicitly whitelisted in .env (WHITELISTED_SOURCES).
                Everywhere else it prepares a complete draft and waits for
                your approval. See agents/search_agent.py:WHITELISTABLE_SOURCES
                for which source types can ever be whitelisted at all (only
                Greenhouse/Lever, since they're the only ones with a
                documented public API to submit against).

This is also the single gate a job re-entering here via orchestrator.py's
route_after_rewrite (a rewritten CV whose tailored score cleared the fit
threshold) passes through -- so AUTO_APPLY_MODE applies identically whether
a job arrived here directly or via a CV rewrite.

The email route: many postings (most in Egypt and the Gulf) say "send your CV
to hr@company.com". find_application_email() reads that address out of the
posting, and when config.AUTO_APPLY_EMAIL is on the gate returns
"email_apply" -- the tailored CV and a cover letter go out through the user's
Gmail (orchestrator.py's email_apply_node). AUTO_APPLY_MODE="off" still wins:
that mode promises nothing is sent without the user, so it drafts instead,
with the address ready in the draft.
