CV scoring: ATS compatibility and job match.

Two questions, deliberately kept apart:

    ATS Compatibility   "can a parser read this document at all?" A property
                        of the CV alone, with no job involved, so it is
                        computed once and reported as Pass/Warning/Fail
                        rather than mixed into a per-job number.
    Job Match           "how well does this candidate satisfy THIS job?"
                        Requirement-level, evidence-backed, deterministic.

Mixing them is the defect this design exists to prevent: a candidate with
excellent experience and slightly imperfect formatting could rank below a weak
candidate with tidy formatting, because 40% of every score was a CV-level
constant that never saw the job description.

The four-pillar scorer that used to live here alongside this one was retired
once the requirements engine had replaced it everywhere. It was measured
against the 15 real applications in this project's database and had two
defects the numbers made unarguable: formatting and section completeness
returned the same value on every job (a constant carrying 40% of the weight
and zero ranking signal), and years of experience were read as
max(year) - min(year) over every number in the CV, which scores a graduation
year and a copyright notice as employment. SCORING.md keeps the measurements;
the code is gone rather than sitting unreachable.

What is kept from the original design, deliberately: every score carries a
breakdown and a plain-English explanation, the final number is computed in
Python rather than produced by an LLM, extracted requirements are reused when
re-scoring a tailored CV, and nothing claims a skill the CV does not support.

- importance is "required" only when the posting presents it as a must-have. Anything under "nice to have", "preferred", "bonus", or "a plus" is "preferred".
- Use category "responsibility" for what the person will DO (e.g. "Deploy models to production"), not for skills.
- Use category "experience" only for years-of-experience or seniority statements.
- Do not list the same requirement twice. Do not invent requirements the posting does not state.
- "type" is "skill" for a named thing someone either has or does not ("PyTorch", "Kubernetes"), and "capability" for something a CV demonstrates through work rather than by naming it ("stakeholder management", "requirements gathering", "campaign performance analysis"). Use "credential" for degrees and certifications, "experience" for years/seniority statements.
- "concept_family" is a short grouping label ("web_framework", "cloud_platform", "collaboration"), or null when nothing obvious fits. It is used for reporting, never for scoring.
- "evidence_expected" is what the posting asks for: "hands_on" when it wants direct use, "demonstrated" when it wants shown-through-work, "familiarity" when exposure is enough, "any" when it does not say."""
