"""
Structured CV parsing, cached by CV hash.

Replaces _estimate_cv_experience_years() from the original ats_agent, which
computed years of experience as:

    max(years_mentioned) - min(years_mentioned)

The module's own docstring conceded this "can't distinguish an employment date
range from, say, a graduation year". In practice that is not a rough proxy but
a wrong answer. For a CV reading

    Education   2019-2023
    Internship  2024
    Project     2025

it returns 6 years of experience for someone with roughly one. Any 4-digit
number in range counts -- a citation year, "ImageNet 2012", a copyright
notice. The error is unbounded and always in the flattering direction, and it
fed a pillar worth 15% of the score.

Here the CV is parsed into dated entries instead, professional entries are
identified as such, and their intervals are MERGED before summing -- so two
concurrent roles, or an internship overlapping a degree, count once rather
than twice.

Why this is cached
------------------
The CV changes rarely; job descriptions change every job. Hoisting the parse
out of the per-job path means a run costs one LLM call for the CV plus one per
job, instead of two per job. Cached to disk next to the CV embedding cache and
keyed the same way -- on content hash AND model, because a profile produced by
a different model is not interchangeable, and a cache keyed on content alone
would silently serve one model's parse to another. (That exact bug bit this
project once already, in the CV embedding cache, where a key missing the
provider would have served vectors of the wrong dimensionality and scored
everything 0.0.)

Rules:
- Copy contact details exactly as written. Use null for anything absent. Never
  guess an email, phone number or profile URL.
- "title" is the professional headline printed under the name, if the CV has
  one. Do NOT substitute the most recent job title for it, and do not invent
  one -- use null when the CV states no headline.
- is_professional is true for paid employment INCLUDING internships, false for
  coursework, volunteering, and personal projects.
- Do NOT invent dates. If a date is absent, use null.
- Copy locations and project links exactly as written, and use null when the
  CV gives none. Never infer a company's headquarters as the role's location
  or guess a repository URL from a project name.
- Do NOT infer skills that are not written in the CV. skills_claimed contains
  only what a skills/technologies section actually lists.
- Copy bullets verbatim. They are used as evidence and must be quotable."""
