Pipeline shape (see ARCHITECTURE.md "Job matching"):

Retrieval is recall-biased and cheap; ranking is the expensive, precise pass,

    `position`/`seniority`/`max_results_per_site`/`max_age_days` default to
    the matching config.SEARCH_* value (whatever's saved from the Search tab)
    when not explicitly passed, so the 8am scheduler run and any CLI
    invocation automatically stay in sync with whatever's saved -- only pass
    them explicitly to override for a single run.

    Each job is written to the database in short, independent transactions
    (see _process_one_job) rather than one transaction covering the whole
    batch. This matters because SQLite only allows one writer at a time even
    in WAL mode (see db.py): holding a single transaction open across every
    job's orchestrator call -- which is several LLM round-trips, easily
    seconds per job -- meant a batch of dozens of jobs could hold the write
    lock for minutes. Any other process trying to write during that window
    (the scheduler's own automatic run overlapping a manual "Search now"
    click, for example) would blow through even a generous busy_timeout and
    fail outright with "database is locked" -- a real failure seen in
    production. Keeping each transaction down to a single row write means
    the lock is only ever held for milliseconds, so genuine overlap between
    two runs just makes one of them wait briefly instead of erroring.
